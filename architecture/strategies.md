I would like to build an AI assistant to help me with my daily tasks. The assistant should have access to certain tools and capabilities to answer my questions and provide me with relevant contents.

I'm in doubt between two different strategies:

Build a single agent solution with multiple tools that continues the conversation with me and shares more info based on my inputs.
Build a multi-agent solution in which agents can communicate together. The point is that most multi-agent frameworks are designed for autonomous tasks not interacting with the user for every and each step.
Please clarify and suggest other possible approaches

=================

You're considering two common strategies for building an AI assistant. Let's break them down and explore other possibilities:

1. Single Agent with Multiple Tools:

How it works: A single AI agent manages the conversation with you. When needed, it uses various tools (like search engines, calculators, calendar APIs, etc.) to gather information or perform actions. It then synthesizes this information to answer your questions or fulfill requests.
Pros:
Simpler to build and manage: The architecture is more straightforward.
Coherent conversation: Easier to maintain context and flow since one agent handles all interaction.
Direct control: The agent's behavior and tool usage are centrally managed.
Cons:
Scalability: Can become complex if the number of tools and the range of tasks become very large.
Single point of failure: If the main agent has limitations, the whole system is affected.
2. Multi-Agent Solution (with inter-agent communication):

How it works: Multiple specialized AI agents collaborate. For example, one agent might be an expert in scheduling, another in research, and a third in summarizing information. They communicate with each other to solve your request. A primary "user-facing" agent might still be needed to interact with you and coordinate the others.
Pros:
Specialization: Each agent can be highly optimized for specific tasks.
Modularity: Easier to update or replace individual agents.
Potential for complex problem-solving: Can tackle multifaceted tasks by combining the strengths of different agents.
Cons:
Complexity: Designing, orchestrating, and debugging inter-agent communication can be challenging.
Maintaining user interaction: As you noted, many frameworks are designed for autonomous tasks. Ensuring continuous, step-by-step interaction with the user across multiple agents requires careful design to manage conversation state and turn-taking. It can be difficult to make the experience feel seamless.
Overhead: Communication between agents can introduce latency.
Other Possible Approaches & Suggestions:

Hybrid Approach (Hierarchical Agents):

This is often a practical and powerful middle ground. You'd have a primary "orchestrator" or "user-facing" agent that interacts directly with you.
This primary agent can then delegate specific sub-tasks to specialized "worker" or "expert" agents (which could be simpler LLM calls or more complex agents themselves).
The worker agents perform their tasks and return results to the primary agent, which then synthesizes the information and continues the conversation with you.
This approach maintains a clear point of interaction for the user while leveraging the benefits of specialized agents. It's like the single-agent model, but some of its "tools" are actually other agents.
Function Calling / Tool-Augmented LLMs:

This is closely related to the "single agent with multiple tools" model and is a very common pattern with modern LLMs. The LLM itself is the core agent. You define a set of available functions (tools) that the LLM can choose to call to get external information or perform actions.
The LLM decides when to call a function, what inputs to provide, and then integrates the function's output back into its response to you.
This is highly effective for interactive assistants.
Recommendation for Your Use Case:

Given your goal of an AI assistant for daily tasks that "continues the conversation with me and shares more info based on my inputs," I would suggest starting with:

A Single Agent with robust Tool/Function Calling capabilities. This directly addresses your need for continuous interaction and is generally easier to implement and iterate on.
If the complexity grows, evolve towards a Hybrid/Hierarchical Approach. Your main conversational agent can then delegate more complex or specialized sub-tasks to other agents or specialized LLM calls, treating them as advanced tools.
This evolutionary path allows you to start simpler and add complexity where it provides clear benefits, without immediately jumping into the full complexity of a multi-agent system designed for autonomy. The key is to ensure the user interaction remains central and coherent.
